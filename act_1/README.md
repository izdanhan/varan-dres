# 🗡️ Shadow Path: Act I Roadmap (Levels 1–15)

A step-by-step guide for **Varan’s early journey**, weaving together Illusion, Sneak, and One-Handed growth while staying true to the assassin/vampire path. This path covers the time **after escaping Helgen** up through the foundation of the **Dark Brotherhood** and entry into the **College of Winterhold**.

---

## **Phase 1: Emergence from Helgen (Level 1–3)**

- **Guardian Stones** → choose **Thief Stone** for Sneak/Illusion progression (Warrior Stone can be used temporarily for One-Handed training).  
- **Anise’s Cabin** → loot alchemy ingredients, enchantment table access, and roleplay discovery of Skyrim’s hidden occult undercurrents.  
- **Embershard Mine** → stealth clear for early Sneak XP, iron ingots, and starting gear. Ideal for practicing backstabs and bow shots.  
- **Optional Detour:** Wolves and bandits on the road to Riverwood make good “practice targets” for testing Fear spells and dagger strikes.

**Result:** Riverwood is reached with a foundation of Sneak/One-Handed skills, early gold, and loot for trading.

---

## **Phase 2: The Mask of Normalcy (Level 3–5)**

- **Riverwood:**  
  - Sell loot at **Lucan Valerius’s shop**.  
  - Take **Golden Claw** quest but postpone Bleak Falls Barrow.  
  - Train smithing with Alvor — forge daggers/bracers.  
- **Whiterun:**  
  - Deliver message to Jarl Balgruuf.  
  - Speak to **Farengar Secret-Fire** for Novice Illusion spells (Calm, Courage, Fear). Train Illusion when possible.  
  - Kill the first dragon at **Western Watchtower** → unlock Shouts, completing your “hero façade.”  

**Result:** You are known as Dragonborn, but your true ambitions remain hidden.

---

## **Phase 3: The Road to Darkness (Level 5–8)**

- **Journey to Riften:**  
  - Practice Sneak on the road (bandit camps, wolves, travelers).  
  - **Fishing (AE):** Begin questline at the docks, a perfect cover identity.  
  - **Unfathomable Depths (Riften docks):** Accept quest from From-Deepest-Fathoms; hold for later.  
- **Optional Side Activities:**  
  - Steal from Riften homes for Pickpocket/Sneak practice.  
  - Begin shaping the assassin persona under a mask of a wandering fisherman-scholar.

**Result:** First AE quests logged, “fisherman’s guise” established, and Sneak steadily advancing.

---

## **Phase 4: The Dark Invitation (Level 8–12)**

- **Travel to Windhelm:**  
  - Investigate Aventus Aretino.  
  - Complete **Innocence Lost** (kill Grelod with a dagger sneak attack).  
  - Sleep → kidnapped by Astrid → join the **Dark Brotherhood.**  
- **Dark Brotherhood Contracts:**  
  - Progress until **Recipe for Disaster** to establish base of operations and acquire essential gear.  
  - Roleplay your feeding habits hidden under the guise of Brotherhood contracts.  

**Result:** You now have a sanctuary, contracts, and a faction that matches your nature.

---

## **Phase 5: The Scholarly Mask (Level 12–15)**

- **Journey to Winterhold:**  
  - Join the College. Gain access to **Drevis Neloren** for Illusion training.  
  - Purchase **Muffle** immediately; save for **Invisibility** later.  
- **Perk Progression (priorities):**  
  - **Sneak:** Muffled Movement → Backstab  
  - **Illusion:** Novice Illusion → Animage  
  - **One-Handed:** Armsman (1/5)  

- **Optional AE Additions:**  
  - **Gallows Hall (AE):** If you want a necromantic foothold early, it’s just east of Windhelm. Could serve as a dark laboratory before Bloodchill Manor (Act II).  
  - **Spell Knight Armor (AE):** Quest starts near Whiterun; gear can be roleplayed as a disguise before your true transformation.  

**Result:** Act I ends with you:  
- Dragonborn façade maintained.  
- Brotherhood allegiance secured.  
- Illusion path established through the College.  
- Sneak/One-Handed on track for assassination efficiency.  

---

## 📌 Summary of Act I Goals
- Unlock Shouts (but halt main quest after first dragon).  
- Initiate Dark Brotherhood and gain sanctuary.  
- Establish Illusion training path via College of Winterhold.  
- Begin integrating AE side content for roleplay and utility.
