# ü©∏ The Path of Varan Dres: A Vampire Nightblade Guide

## üìñ Character Concept: The Shadow Behind the Smile

**Name:** Varan Dres ‚Äì ‚ÄúVaran‚Äù (shade) + Dres (House known for slavery and cruelty). A simple, cold, and cruel name for a Dunmer Nightblade Vampire.

**Background:** Once a loyal retainer of House Dres, Varan grew disillusioned with their petty squabbles and sought true power in manipulation and blood. He views kindness as weakness, morality as a cage, and chaos as the natural order. He willingly embraced vampirism, seeing undeath as the ultimate form of control. He is the shadow behind a polite smile, the hand that turns friend against friend, and the whisper that pushes mortals into ruin.

***

## üé≠ Core Roleplay Principles

- **The Mask:** Always be polite and civil in public. Your smile is a tool for manipulation, never a reflection of your true intentions.
- **No Morals:** Kill innocents if it benefits you. Ally with Daedric Princes without hesitation. Outcomes that cause suffering are preferable.
- **The Manipulator:** Use Illusion magic to make others fight your battles. Why get your hands dirty when a guard can kill his allies for you?
- **The Predator:** Feed regularly for roleplay, but maintain higher vampire stages for stronger powers. Travel and operate primarily at night.
- **Tools, Not Friends:** Followers and allies exist to be used. Dispose of them when they are no longer convenient or become a liability.

## üß≠ Quest & Level Progression Guide

Follow this path for a natural story flow that fits Varan's rise to power.

### **Levels 1-15: The Mask of Civilization**

- **Main Quest:** Complete "Until Escape from Helgen" ‚Üí "Before the Storm" (introduces Farengar, who sells Illusion spells). Then pause. Dragons are a background nuisance, not your primary concern.
- **Illusion Training:** Travel to the **College of Winterhold**. Join to gain access to expert Illusion trainers and spells. This is your public facade of scholarly pursuit.
- **The First Contract:** Go to Windhelm. Hear the rumor about Aventus Aretino. Complete **"Innocence Lost"** and kill Grelod the Kind. Join the **Dark Brotherhood**. The Shrouded Armor and Blade of Woe are your perfect starter kit.
- **AE Content - Blending In:**
    - Visit the **Rare Curios** sold by Khajiit caravans. Roleplay acquiring exotic poisons and ingredients.
    - Dabble in **Fishing** quests in major towns. This is how you maintain your "civilian" mask and listen for rumors.

### **Levels 15-25: Embracing the Curse**

- **Dawnguard:** When approached by a Durak or hearing rumors in Dayspring Canyon, begin the Dawnguard questline. Immediately side with **Lord Harkon and the Volkihar Clan**. This is your true turning point. Become a Vampire Lord.
- **Dark Brotherhood:** Continue advancing the DB questline. Your contracts now double as hunting opportunities.
- **Daedric Patrons:** Seek out your true allies.
    - **Molag Bal (The House of Horrors in Markarth):** The patron of vampires. A must.
    - **Mehrunes Dagon (The Mythic Dawn Museum):** The Prince of Destruction. His razor is a fine tool.
- **AE Content - A Home Fit for a Predator:**
    - Complete the quest for **Bloodchill Manor**. This vampire-themed home is the perfect lair for Varan. Make it your primary residence.

### **Levels 25-35: Weaving a Web of Chaos**

- **Dark Brotherhood:** Complete the storyline. You are now the listener and de facto leader of a powerful guild of assassins.
- **Illusion Mastery:** With Quiet Casting and Master of the Mind, you can control any situation. Use Frenzy in crowded marketplaces and watch the chaos unfold.
- **Thieves Guild (Optional):** Infiltrate the Guild in Riften. Your goal isn't friendship, but to gain access to its wealth and influence over Skyrim's underworld.
- **AE Content - Spreading Madness:**
    - Embark on the **Saints & Seducers** questline (start by finding a mad mage or helping a Khajiit caravan). The Daedric chaos of the Mad Lord Sheogorath is a playground for you.

### **Levels 35+: The Dark Lord Ascendant**

You are now a power in Skyrim. Choose your path:

- **The Vampire Lord:** Solidify your rule with the Volkihar. Complete their questline.
- **The Master Assassin:** Use the Dark Brotherhood to strike fear across the land.
- **The Necromancer King:** Acquire **Gallows Hall (AE)** and blend Vampire Lord powers with necromancy, commanding an army of the dead.
- **The Daedric Pawnmaster:** Hunt down all Daedric Artifacts, seeing them as trophies of your supreme manipulation.

## üïØÔ∏è Immersive Playstyle Tips

- **Kill with Style:** Always prefer a stealth dagger kill. If discovered, use Illusion spells like Frenzy or Fear to create chaos, then strike from the shadows.
- **Live the Cycle:** Travel by night. "Sleep" in your coffin at Bloodchill Manor or in other vampire lairs during the day.
- **Dress the Part:** Wear Shrouded Armor for contracts, fine clothes or robes in cities, and Vampire Royal Armor in your lair.
- **Let the World Guide You:** Don't just fast-travel. Walk between locations at night, hunt wildlife and lone travelers, and stumble upon dungeons and camps naturally. If you have **Survival Mode**, this is highly recommended for the added challenge of feeding and avoiding the cold.
- **Read Books & Listen:** Many quests, especially AE ones, start from books or rumors. Let your curiosity guide you.

This path will take you from a disgraced noble to the most feared shadow in Skyrim, using the new Anniversary Edition content to deepen your roleplay without ever losing sight of who Varan Dres is.
