# ü©∏ The Complete Path of Varan Dres: The Shadow Behind the Smile

## üìñ Core Philosophy & Identity

**True Name:** Varan Dres
**Alias:** None. He wears his name like a badge of dishonor, a warning to those who know what House Dres represents.
**Motto:** *"From the ashes of a weak house, a stronger predator rises."*

**Background Refined:** Varan wasn't merely disillusioned with House Dres; he was disgusted by their stagnation. They clung to the old ways‚Äîslavery, agrarian power‚Äîwhile the world moved on. He saw true power not in owning flesh, but in owning *will*. He seeks to build a new kind of House, not of land and slaves, but of influence, fear, and immortal agents. He sees vampirism not as a curse, but as an evolutionary advantage, a necessary step for a Dunmer to transcend their mortal limitations and reclaim a sense of supreme, unchallenged authority.

## üé≠ Deep-Roleplay Principles

- **The Dunmer Contempt:** As a Dres, look down on the Argonians and Khajiit. See them as lesser beings, prime candidates for manipulation or feeding. View the Nords as brutish, unsubtle fools.
- **The Vampire's Aesthetic:** Reject crude armor. Prefer fine clothes, dark robes, or elegant, light armor like the Vampire Royal Armor or the sleek Bonemold (AE). Your appearance is a tool of deception.
- **The Art of the Deal:** Never commit violence when a well-placed lie or a manipulated enemy will do the work for you. Bribe officials, blackmail merchants, and use the **Speechcraft** skill to its fullest.
- **Document Your Rise:** Use the **Journal of the Dragonborn (Mod-like RP, but vanilla)**. Actually write in a physical notebook or a digital document. Record your kills, your manipulations, and your growing power. Note the moment you decided to spare or sacrifice Serana, for instance.
- **Home is a Statement:** Your primary residence is **Bloodchill Manor (AE)**. Use **Gallows Hall (AE)** as a necromantic research outpost. **Hendraheim (AE)** is too "heroic"; **Myrwatch** too mage-oriented. These are not just houses; they are strongholds of your influence.

## üß≠ The Living Quest Guide: A Campaign of Shadows

This is your chronological path through Skyrim. Do not rush. Let each phase breathe.

### **ACT I: THE ASPIRING BLADE (Levels 1-15)**

- **Objective:** Establish your facade and acquire your basic tools of the trade.
- **Main Quest:** Escape Helgen. Go to Riverwood. Deliver the message to Whiterun. **Stop after killing the first dragon at the Western Watchtower.** You have now proven yourself capable and unlocked shouts, a useful tool. The fate of the world bores you.
- **The Essential Questline:** Immediately travel to Windhelm. Hear the rumor of Aventus Aretino. Complete **"Innocence Lost."** Kill Grelod with a dagger sneak attack. Sleep to initiate the Dark Brotherhood. Complete the first few contracts up to **"Recipe for Disaster"** to get your base of operations and essential gear.
- **The Scholarly Mask:** Travel to Winterhold. Join the College. Your goal is not to become Arch-Mage, but to gain access to the Illusion master, Drevis Neloren. Train with him until you can buy the **Invisibility** spell. This is your single most important goal in the early game.
- **Anniversary Edition Integration:**
    - **Fishing:** Start the quest in Riften. It's a perfect cover activity. The **Dwarven Fishing Rod (AE)** is a minor but useful treasure.
    - **The Cause & The Consequences:** **Ignore this for now.** It's too high-level and central to the main plot. It belongs in Act III.
    - **Unfathomable Depths:** Start this in Riften's docks. The quest reward, **Ancient Knowledge,** provides a permanent armor bonus, which is invaluable.

### **ACT II: THE BLOODED PREDATOR (Levels 15-30)**

- **Objective:** Shed your mortality and fully embrace the power of vampirism and daedric manipulation.
- **The Turning Point:** You will be approached by a Dawnguard hunter or hear rumors in towns. Go to Fort Dawnguard. Meet Isran and then Lord Harkon. **Without hesitation, choose to become a Vampire Lord.** This is the core of your transformation. Complete the quest **"Bloodline"** to secure your place in Volkihar.
- **Dark Brotherhood Advancement:** Continue your contracts. Weave them into your nightly hunts. Roleplay that the Brotherhood is the perfect cover for your feeding habits. Complete the questline to become a master of the void and silence.
- **Daedric Pilgrimage:** It is time to seek powerful patrons.
    - **Molag Bal (Markarth):** You must own the Mace of Molag Bal. It is your birthright as a vampire.
    - **Mehrunes Dagon (The Mythic Dawn Museum):** The Razor is a fickle but incredibly powerful tool for an assassin.
    - **Clavicus Vile (Falkreath):** The Masque of Clavicus Vile is perfect for enhancing your social manipulation.
    - **Peryite (Falkreath):** Seek out the Afflicted. Their state of disease is a form of control. **Spellbreaker** is a powerful defensive tool.
- **Anniversary Edition Integration:**
    - **Bloodchill Manor:** Complete this quest now. This is your new home. Store your treasures here, display your artifacts. This is Varan's seat of power.
    - **Ghosts of the Tribunal (AE):** As a Dunmer, this is crucial. Travel to Solstheim. Find the Old Attius Farm and begin the quest to recover the relics of your people's false gods. The **Robes of the Tribunal** are a fitting attire for a new god-king. The **Trueflame** and **Hopesfire** replicas are powerful weapons.
    - **The Forgotten Seasons:** A massive underground Dwemer ruin. The automatons within are the ultimate slaves‚Äîmindless, perfect laborers. Looting it is a worthy endeavor.

### **ACT III: THE DARK LORD ASCENDANT (Levels 30-50+)**

- **Objective:** Consolidate power, sow chaos, and become the undisputed shadow ruler of Skyrim.
- **Dawnguard Conclusion:** Complete the Volkihar storyline. Decide the fate of the Dawnguard and Serana based on your whims. Do you keep a powerful vampire thrall? Or dispose of a potential rival?
- **Thieves Guild (Optional):** If you haven't already, infiltrate the Guild. Your goal is not to help them, but to **complete the Crown of Barenziah quest.** The resulting passive effect of finding countless gems is the ultimate economic power, making you richer than any Jarl.
- **The Ultimate Manipulation:** With Master Illusion spells like **Mayhem**, you can clear entire forts without lifting a finger. Use this power. Go to a bandit camp, cast Mayhem, and watch from the shadows as they slaughter each other. Then, walk in and claim the prize.
- **Anniversary Edition Integration:**
    - **The Cause & The Consequences:** Now is the time. You are powerful enough to open a gate to the Deadlands. This is not about saving Skyrim; it's about proving your dominance over Mehrunes Dagon's realm and claiming the **Dragonbone Mail (AE)** and **Chrysamere (AE)** for your collection.
    - **Gallows Hall:** Complete this quest to claim your necromantic sanctum. This is where you experiment with raising the dead, blending your vampiric nature with necromantic arts.
    - **Saints & Seducers:** Complete this questline. The chaos of the Mad God is a delightful distraction. The unique staves and armor are excellent trophies.
    - **Shadowfoot Sanctum (Riften):** Purchase this thieves' den as a city-base for your operations in The Rift.

## üó∫Ô∏è Regional Guide: How to Behave in Skyrim

- **Whiterun:** Your "public" face. Be polite. Use the Bannered Mare for rumors. Do not cause overt chaos here; it's your central hub.
- **Windhelm:** A city of strife. Feed on the Argonians in the docks or the unwanted in the Gray Quarter. Stir up trouble with Frenzy spells in the Stone Quarter.
- **Markarth:** A city built on lies and deceit. You fit right in. Ally with the Silver-Bloods for practical gain. Explore the Dwemer ruins beneath it for technology to exploit.
- **Riften:** A den of thieves. Operate here freely. The Black-Briars are useful pawns. Use the canals for easy escape after a feed.
- **Solitude:** The seat of Imperial power. A challenge. Operate here with extreme subtlety. The Blue Palace is a symbol of the order you despise.
- **Winterhold:** A blasted ruin. A reminder of the folly of mortals. The College is merely a library to you.

This path will transform you from a nobody into the most feared and influential power in Skyrim, a true Shadow Behind the Smile, using every tool the game and the Anniversary Edition provides. Now go, and make Skyrim fear the night.
